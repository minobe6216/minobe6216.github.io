<h2>
    American Restaurants
</h2>

<h3><a href="https://www.steamboatque.com/">Steamboat BBQ</a> $$</h3>

<p>
    Steamboat BBQ is the place to go when you're craving the rich tangy BBQ flavor.  My favorites are the ribs and the
    smoked BLT.
</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.portillos.com/index.html">Portillo's </a> $</h3>

<p>
    Portillo's is just everyone's favorite.  My favorite is the Maxwell Street Polish.  This amazing hot dog made of
    chard polish sausage, caramelized, onions, and a hefty load of mustard.  However, it's a must to try at least all of
    their hot dogs.
</p>

<h2>Irish Restaurant</h2>

<h3><a href="http://www.village-tavern-grill.com/schaumburg-mainpage">Village Tavern & Grill </a> $$</h3>

<p>
    Their world famous chicken fingers.  It is a gift from heaven.  Although the chicken fingers he sauce makes it one
    million times better and godly.
</p>

<h2>Mexican Restaurant</h2>

<h3>Pancho's Burritos $</h3>

<p> My family always takes out here.  Our favorite is the Giant Steak Burrito.  The steak is very flavorful and is
    great.  Most of their dishes comes with two spicy sauces, the red one and the green one.  These sauces both pairs
    with the dishes and enhances their dishes to a whole another level.
</p>

<h2>Italian Restaurant</h2>

<h3><a href="https://www.garibaldis.com/">Garibaldi's Italian Eatery</a> $$</h3>

<p>
    I would call Garibaldi's food an American Italian and it is the best kind.  Although their food is not the most
    traditional italian, their food is everyone's favorite with the simple but flavorful dishes.  Plus, they are very
    supportive in fundraising and school activities and that is always great!!
</p>

<h2>Japanese Restaurants</h2>

<h3><a href="https://www.ramen-shinchan.com/">Shin Chan Ramen</a> $</h3>

<p> My favorite dishes from this Nagoya originated ramen restaurant is the Tonkotsu Ramen and the Miso Ramen.  Tonkotsu
    means pork bone and miso is fermented soy bean paste.  Throughout Japan there are countless amounts of types of miso.
    The miso used in this ramen is Nagoya's regional red miso.  As an appetizer my recommendations are Gyoza and Kara Age.
</p>

<h3>Daruma Restaurant $$$</h3>

<p>
    This is where to go when you want to eat one of the best japanese food not just in Schaumburg but in the world.
    Their dishes are all very sophisticated and you will be getting what you pay for.  My favorite dish so far out of
    their range of superb dishes is the miso tontoro.
</p>

<h2>Chinese Restaurants</h2>

<h3><a href="http://noodlesdelight.com/">Noodle's Delight</a> $$</h3>

<p>
    Noodle's Delight is an all time favorite for my family and we keep on going back to it.  My recommendation is the
    Beef Chow Fun.
</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.chefping.com/">Chef Ping</a> $$$</h3>

<p>
    Chef Ping is always full, but it's huge!  I feel like that explains the how tasty their foods are.  My favorite
    dish, the Pong Pong chicken is fried lollipop chicken with spicy, tangy sauce.
</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.yusrestaurant.com/">Yu's Mandarin</a> $$$</h3>

<p>
    Yu's Mandarin is beautiful in every way there is.  The restaurant's exterior and interior is always clean and pretty,
    their food tastes so good it's beautiful.  My favorite dish is the Noodle Soup.

</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.katysdumpling.com/Katys_Dumpling_Oak_Park/index.html">Katy's Dumpling</a> $$</h3>

<p>
    This chinese restaurant is very small however, their Juicy Steam Buns and Pan Fried Pork Buns are miraculous.  The
    restaurant is usually full because it is so small but it's worth the wait.
</p>

<h2>Thai Restaurant</h2>

<h3><a href="http://danthaionline.com/">Dan Thai</a> $$</h3>

<p>
    This place is definitely the best Thai restaurant around the area.  My favorite dishes are the Tom Yum Soup,Pad
    Thai,and Pad Se-ew.
