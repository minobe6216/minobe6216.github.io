<h3>
    Pancho's Burritos
</h3>
<p> My family always takes out here.  Our favorite is the Giant Steak Burrito.  The steak is very flavorful and is
    great.  Most of their dishes comes with two spicy sauces, the red one and the green one.  These sauces both pairs
    with the dishes and enhances their dishes to a whole another level.

<p> My favorite dishes from this Nagoya originated ramen restaurant is the Tonkotsu Ramen and the Miso Ramen.  Tonkotsu
    means pork bone and miso is fermented soy bean paste.  Through out Japan thereare countless amounts of types of miso.
    The miso used in this ramen is Nagoya's regional red miso.  As an appetizer my reccomendations are Gyoza and Kara Age.

    This is where to go when you want to eat one of the best japanese food not just in Schaumburg but in the world.
    Their dishes are all very sophisticated and you will be getting what you pay for.  My favorite dish so far out of
    their range of superb dishes is the miso tontoro.

    This chinese restaurant is very small however, their Juicy Steam Buns and Pan Fried Pork Buns are miraculous.  The
    restaurant is usually full because it is so small but it's worth the wait.
